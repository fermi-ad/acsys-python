# ACSys Python DPM Client

`acsys` is the interface to Fermilab data acquisition and control.

_EXAMPLES:_ If you are looking for examples to dive in on, please see the [wiki examples](https://github.com/fermi-controls/acsys-python/wiki/Example-DAQ-scripts).

## Installing

`acsys` is available via a Fermi hosted pip repository.

```bash
python3 -m pip install acsys --extra-index-url https://www-bd.fnal.gov/pip3
```

The command above will get you up and going quickly. See usage examples in the [wiki](https://github.com/fermi-controls/acsys-python/wiki).

If you need to perform settings, you will need the optional authentication library, `gssapi`.

```bash
python3 -m pip install "acsys[settings]" --extra-index-url https://www-bd.fnal.gov/pip3
```

Note: This package only authenticates you as a user. There are other requirements to be able to set devices. Please make a request to the Controls Department for setting access.

## Building and Distributing

All dependencies are managed via pyproject.toml.

Start by creating and activating a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

To build the project, ensure you have your development dependencies installed.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This command installs your project in an editable mode along with all its development dependencies, like `build` and `wheel`.

Make sure `pyproject.toml` has the correct version number.

```bash
make
```

will create a source distribution at `./dist`.

This should only be used for development.

```bash
make all
```

The above will generate "built distributions" as well as the source distributions from `make`.

## Releasing a New Version

### Set the new version

Ensure all your changes are committed to Git. Create a new Git tag for the version you are releasing. The tag name should follow the semver format `vX.Y.Z`.

```bash
git tag vVID
```

### Deploy the distributions

Run the `deploy` make target to build the package and push it to the pip server. This process will automatically use the new version from your Git tag.

```bash
make deploy
```

### Push the tags

Finally, push the new tag to the remote repository. This makes the new version official in your project's history.

```bash
git push --tags
```

## Development

To get started with development, simply follow the "Building and Distributing" section. The `pip install -e ".[dev]"` command will set up your virtual environment so that any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected in your `venv`.
